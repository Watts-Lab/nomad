# Nomad
Network for Open Mobility Analysis and Data

## About Nomad
NOMAD provides a repository of processing and analysis methods for GPS mobility data, centralizing tools necessary for large-scale analyses. This repository will serve the dual function of facilitating research for first-time users and enhancing the replicability and robustness of existing methodologies. By collecting many such methods in a single place and documenting their assumptions and robustness metrics, NOMAD aims to enhance methodological transparency and replicability of research.

**Objective 3.** Nomad will form the core around which a community of researchers can coalesce. Although we will be the primary developers of initial assets, over time the relevant research community will play an increasing role in refining practices and tackling data challenges.

Nomad offers PySpark and Python implementations of spatial data processing, human mobility metrics and epidemic modeling including:
* Stop detection algorithms
* Home attribution
* Normalization
