    "To create a city, begin by initializing a `City` of the desired dimension. Then successively add `Buildings` to the city by defining their type, door location, and geometry (either as a bounding box or a list of block coordinates). The door coordinate is given by the street block that the building door faces. The final step is to call `city.get_street_graph()`, which generates the shortest paths between all blocks. As an example, we generate a city in which buildings are arranged in concentric rings, with a park in the center, following a ring of residences, a ring of retail locations, and, finally, an outer ring of workplaces."

Conversely, a finer parametrization may completely miss a stop at a larger location (as in the bottom left panel) or erroneously cluster a larger stop as two distinct, shorter stops (as in the bottom right panel). Only the top right panel in this example accurately detected the three stops. Thus, it seems like the optimal parameters for a given trajectory could be selected based on the clustering structure and not only on the ping frequency."
